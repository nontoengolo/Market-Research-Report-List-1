<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR system</li><li>EGR system</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System market primarily includes two key technologies: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems. SCR systems reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by injecting a urea-based solution into the exhaust stream, converting harmful gases into harmless nitrogen and water. In contrast, EGR systems reduce emissions by recirculating a portion of exhaust gases back into the engine's intake, lowering combustion temperatures and reducing NOx emissions. Both systems are critical for meeting stringent emissions regulations.</p></p>
