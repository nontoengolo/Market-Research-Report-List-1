<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cryo Preservation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cryo preservation equipment operates primarily in two market types: liquid phase and vapor phase. The liquid phase involves storing biological samples directly in liquid nitrogen, ensuring optimal thermal conditions for longer viability. Conversely, the vapor phase uses the space above the liquid nitrogen, providing a less extreme environment while still maintaining low temperatures. Each method serves distinct applications, with the liquid phase typically supporting samples requiring stricter temperature control, while the vapor phase offers flexibility and improved safety for handling.</p></p>
